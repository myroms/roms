## Earth System Model (ESM) Coupling:

This directory contains several files used for multi-model coupling
using the Earth System Modeling Framework (**ESMF**) with the National
Unified Operational Prediction Capability (**NUOPC**) layer.

The **NUOPC** layer is a simplified **API** on top of the **ESMF** library
(version **8.0** or higher) that provides conventions and templates to facilitate
the smooth coupling between Earth System Model (**ESM**) components. **ROMS**
offers two distinct **NUOPC**-based modules: one for its native coupling framework
(**`esmf_roms.h`**) and the other as a standalone interface for third-party
coupling systems (**`cmeps_roms.h`**).  That is, **ROMS** coupling infrastructure
allows both **DRIVER** and **COMPONENT** methods of operation.

</p>

In the **`DRIVER`** method, it provides all the interfaces needed to couple
to other **ESM** components, including the executable driver, **NUOPC**-based generic
**ESM** component services, model gridded components or **NUOPC** _cap_ modules,
connectors between components for re-gridding source and destination
fields, input scripts, and coupling metadata management.

A **NUOPC** model _cap_ is a Fortran code **API** layer that sits on top of the
**ESM** component, making calls to the numerical kernel via the _`initialize`_,
_`run`_, and _`finalize`_ computational phases.

Alternatively, in the **`COMPONENT`** method, the **NUOPC**-based **ROMS** _cap_
module **`Master/cmeps_roms.h`** is provided, and it can be adapted and
incorporated into other **NUOPC**-based coupling systems, like the
[UFS_coastal Framework](https://github.com/oceanmodeling/ufs-coastal)
using the Community Mediator for Earth Prediction Systems (**CMEPS**) and
the Community Data Models for Earth Predictive Systems (**CDEPS**) coupling
interfaces.

Currently, the following files are available for coupling with the **ESMF/NUOPC**
library:

## Coupling Design:

The strategy is to couple to other **ESM** components with no or minimal
changes to the code distributed by developers or repositories.  The User is
responsible for subscribing to those repositories, downloading, and installing
the other **ESM** components. The coupling with such **ESM** components is expected
not to be affected by its version (previous, current, or future) since the
**NUOPC**-based layer is generic.

However, sometimes, we need to circumvent technical problems when coupling
to other **ESM** components and provide build scripts to facilitate
compiling, linking, and correcting interference to deprecated libraries.
Therefore, this directory may also contain scripts and modified **ESM** component
files that substitute the ones distributed from source repositories
to solve such technical issues.


## WRF Coupling:

Previously, we needed to patch several **WRF** configuration files to correct the
NetCDF4 dependencies and rename collisions with newer versions of the **ESMF** library.
**WRF** adopted the **ESMF** date/time management **API** several years ago and kept the same
function names, but they were never updated. Nowadays, this patching is not required
since we loaded the changes to **feature/fix_compile_dependencies** branch of the
[WRF GitHub](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) repository, which started from
**WRF** version **4.5.1** on Oct. 10,  2023.

Use the following command to download **WRF** from GitHub:

```
git clone -b feature/fix_compile_dependencies https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF
```

The compiling of **WRF** is archaic and convoluted. Thus, we provide a build script
(**build_wrf.csh** or **build_wrf.sh**) to facilitate the compiling and linking in
various computer environments, including Spack-Stack. The resulting **WRF** libraries
can be either static or shared. Also, an additional script (**wrf_move.csh** or **wrf_move.sh**)
is supplied to move (**`-move`** option) **WRF** objects, libraries, and executables to the
User's Project sub-directory **`./Build_wrf`** to facilitate running **WRF** as an atmospheric
component in an **ESMF/NUOPC** coupling system and keep all the configurations in the same place.
To run **WRF**, we need an increasing number of formatted and unformatted input data files that
need to be located annoyingly in the Project directory. We use the **wrf_links.csh** or
**wrf_links.sh** to create the links to those files from the source code root directory.

For example, use the following command to compile and link **WRF**:

```
build_wrf.sh -j 10 -move
```

If compiling with **gfortran**, you may need to activate the environmental variable
**GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT** with **big_endian** to avoid end-of-file when reading binary files
like **RRTMG_LW_DATA**:

```
  export GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT='big_endian'
or
  setenv GFORTRAN_CONVERT_UNIT big_endian
```

needed for configuring and running ROMS-UFS test applications from the **roms_test**
repository. Currently, only the Hurricane Irene application. Also, it illustrate
to use the **sparse-checkout** feature of git.
